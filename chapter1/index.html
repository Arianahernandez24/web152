 <p>My favorite drink is horchata. I grew up drinking a lot of horchata special in parties I went to. Mexican people would make fresh made. It has rice, milk, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and cinnamon. Horchata is a good drink to combine with any kind of food. The food I combine with my horchata is ramen birria. Horchata is a fresh drink that can be consumed in hot and cold weather. </p>
