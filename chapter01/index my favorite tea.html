    <p>Matcha is my favourite tea. I can have it with water or milk, but it always needs to have sugar. Matcha tea helps me a lot when I need energy for the day. Matcha has benefits like healthy digestion and contains fibre. Match can be served in a smoothie, hot tea or just with ice and milk.. When I got to Starbucks, I asked for a smoothie with three scoops of matcha and 2% milk.</p>
